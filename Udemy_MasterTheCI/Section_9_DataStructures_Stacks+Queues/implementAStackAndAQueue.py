*** To implement a stack (LIFO, or Last In First Out)
Can use either dynamic Array, or Linked List

  * Comparison:
    - Pros of Array: Using array, we can put connecting items at connected memory location 
      so technically it can be faster than using linkedlist. Arrays are also a simpler data
      structure and are easier to implement.
    - Pros of LinkedList: With array, we may run out of space because dynamic arrays are 
      implemented using regular arrays, and get copied to a new array with doubled size if
      the old one cannot hold all items. At this moment, is is time consuming to use Array. 
      LinkedList, on the other hand, is very scalable.delattr


*** To implement a queue (FIFO, or First In First Out)
We can only use LinkedList to implement a queue
We can use Arrays to implement it technically. However, as we need to FIFO, we have to unshif
  the whole array when we pop something out. Therefore it's time consuming.

*** Functionalies we need:
